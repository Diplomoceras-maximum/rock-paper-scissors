// Rock, Paper, Scissors

// Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two player game
// Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock
// There is a countdown where players count before playing their choice

// Planning:

// The program will run in console, no user interface needed
// The user will need to enter a choice between rock, paper, scissors
// The computer will randomly select a choice
// The game will have 5 rounds, track scores and declare a winner at the end
